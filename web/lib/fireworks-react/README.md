Tab edit: using https://www.npmjs.com/package/fireworks-react but replacing `this.context` with a non-breaking attribute name.<br/>

A nice fireworks ReactJS component inspired by https://jsfiddle.net/user/dtrooper/fiddles/ work<br/>
Usage: <br/>
&lt;Fireworks width={width} height={height}/&gt; <br/>

Optional properties:<br/>
	style - same as every react component , use map object.<br/>
	background - string, should be css color syntax like rgb or rgba<br/>
        (e.g. background="rgba(0,0,0,0.05)"
